# Movies-Recommender-System

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. This system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze user reviews and recommend movies accordingly.

## Problem Statement
With the growing number of movies being released, users often face challenges in deciding which movies to watch. A recommender system can assist users by providing personalized suggestions, enhancing their experience, and saving time.

## Dataset
- **File**: `main_data.csv`
- **Description**: The dataset contains information about various movies, including their features such as title, genre, and user reviews. It serves as the foundation for building the recommendation model.

## Working of the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Data is cleaned and transformed to prepare it for analysis.
   - NLP techniques are applied to process user reviews.
   - Relevant features are extracted for building the model.
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - A machine learning model is trained using the processed dataset to recommend movies.
   - The model is serialized into `nlp_model.pkl` for future use.
   
3. **Web Interface**:
   - A user-friendly web application is built using Flask.
   - Users can input their preferences or reviews, and the system provides recommendations.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The application is configured for deployment using a `Procfile` and `requirements.txt`.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the creation of a movie recommender system using machine learning and NLP. It includes a dataset for training, pre-processing scripts, a trained model, and a user-friendly web interface. The system aims to simplify decision-making for users and enhance their movie-watching experience.
